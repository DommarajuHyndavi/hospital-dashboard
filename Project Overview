This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of hospital operations, focusing on real-time monitoring of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as bed occupancy, patient inflow and outflow, department-wise efficiency, and resource utilization. The goal is to assist hospital administrators and healthcare staff in making data-driven decisions that improve patient care, optimize resource allocation, and monitor overall hospital performance.
The dashboard is interactive, with slicers and filters that allow users to drill down into specific departments, time ranges, and patient categories. It simplifies complex hospital data into clean, actionable insights to support operational excellence.
